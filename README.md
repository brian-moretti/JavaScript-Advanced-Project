# JavaScript-Advanced-Project di Brian Moretti

My 3rd project for Start2Impact

## About the project

Build an App to boosts the reading of books using the external service [OpenLibrary](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api).  
Starting with a "textbox", the user can search a specific category of a book.  
The app will contact the API of OpenLibrary and show all the information of the books.

### - Build with

This project has been made only with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  
No external libraries has been used neither other frameworks.

## Development Process

- I started from the hardest part, at least for me. Understanding how it works the JS function "fetch(url)" and how to get all the info from the external service.  
- After that I wrote all the code to manipulate the DOM of the App and create all the elements  
- At the end I edit the style of my project and test all the functionality
